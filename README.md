<h4>How it works</h4>
To start with it, ensure that you have needed Item definition, and add more pressing plus sign on action bar.
Time to time, observe inventory list and update balance of particular item. With only one click existing item definitions can be edited or deleted.

In the Create view the user may enter the name of the item and select the category accordingly with the spinner widget, located below the textbox. After the user is done entering the required info he/she can just touch the save button to add the item to the list.

<h5>Deleting an Item </h5>
